  <h1>General  Information about the API</h1>

<p>This is a <strong>REST</strong>(ful) <strong>API</strong> that uses <strong>HTTP request</strong> to <em>reseive,
send, create</em> and <em>delete data</em> and <em>files</em>. <br><br>

This API is created for an application called <strong>"myFlix"</strong>
that interacts with a database that stores data about 
different movies. The users will be able to 
use this application whenever they like to read
information about different movies or update 
their user information, for instance, their list of
favourite movies. <br><br>

The <strong>REST API</strong> will be accessed via <strong>HTTP methods</strong> like
<strong>GET</strong> and <strong>POST</strong>. Similar methods <strong>(CRUD)</strong> will be used 
to retrieve data from the database and store that data 
in a non-relational way. </p>
